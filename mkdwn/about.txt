I built V0.1 of this app in one cold February 2016 night, after I had discovered how useful Shiny is in combination with Plotly. It had already been my wish to interactively visualise distributions since I first learned about them, as I always felt probability density functions were so intangible. I hope that this app will make you feel more comfortable with the various
distribution functions that it includes!
