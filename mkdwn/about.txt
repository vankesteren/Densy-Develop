I built V0.1 of this app in one cold February 2016 night, after I had discovered 
how useful Shiny is in combination with Plotly. It had already been my wish to 
interactively visualise distributions since I first learned about them, as I 
always felt probability density functions were so intangible. I hope that this 
app will make you feel more comfortable with the various distribution functions 
that it includes!

Note that this app is in BETA, meaning it is not finished and you should not 
expect any information to be correct and/or final. 

You can send me an [email](mailto:erikjanvankesteren@gmail.com) if you
want to get in contact. Also, you can [visit my blog](https://vankesteren.github.io/blog)
to learn more about statistics if you're interested!
